# Desktop Without Windows - Your Options

## The Situation

Lenovo doesn't show a Linux option on the configurator. Here are your options:

---

## Option 1: Install Linux Yourself (Recommended)

**What to do:**
1. **Buy desktop with Windows** (you'll pay for it, but don't have to use it)
2. **Install Linux** when you get it (Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.)
3. **Don't activate Windows** - just ignore it
4. **Use Linux** as your main OS

**Cost:**
- You still pay for Windows (it's included in price)
- But you don't have to use it
- Linux is free to install

**Pros:**
- ✅ Get the desktop you want
- ✅ Use Linux (better for dev work)
- ✅ Can dual-boot if needed (Windows + Linux)

**Cons:**
- ❌ Still pay for Windows (even though you won't use it)
- ❌ Need to install Linux yourself (easy though)

## Option 2: Check Business/Education Sales

**Some options:**
- **Lenovo Business Sales** - May offer Linux option
- **Education pricing** - Sometimes has Linux options
- **Volume licensing** - May have Linux option

**How to check:**
- Call Lenovo sales: 1-800-LENOVO
- Ask about Linux option
- Or check Lenovo Business website

## Option 3: Custom Build (No Windows)

**Build your own desktop:**
- **No OS included** - Install Linux yourself
- **Saves money** - No Windows license
- **Full control** - Choose your Linux distro
- **Best value** - ~$600-800 for parts

**Then:**
- Install Ubuntu (free)
- Set up SSH server
- Connect from laptop via VS Code Remote

## Option 4: Buy Refurbished Without OS

**Lenovo Outlet or other sellers:**
- Sometimes have desktops without OS
- Or with Linux pre-installed
- Check: lenovo.com/outlet
- Or: eBay, Amazon (used/refurbished)

## My Recommendation

### Option 1: Buy with Windows, Install Linux

**Why:**
- ✅ Get the desktop you want (ThinkCentre M75s Gen 5)
- ✅ Install Linux when you get it (takes 30 minutes)
- ✅ Don't activate Windows (just ignore it)
- ✅ Use Linux for everything

**Steps:**
1. Buy desktop with Windows 11 Home (included)
2. When it arrives, create Ubuntu USB drive
3. Boot from USB, install Ubuntu
4. Choose "Erase disk and install Ubuntu" (removes Windows)
5. Done! Linux only, no Windows

**Cost:**
- You pay for Windows (included in price)
- But you don't use it
- Linux is free

## Alternative: Custom Build (Best Value)

**If you want to avoid paying for Windows:**

**Build your own:**
- Parts: ~$600-800
- No OS included
- Install Linux yourself
- **Save money** (no Windows license)

**Parts needed:**
- CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5700X (~$180)
- Motherboard: B550 (~$120)
- RAM: 32GB DDR4 (~$80)
- Storage: 1TB NVMe SSD (~$60)
- PSU: 650W (~$80)
- Case: ~$70
- **Total: ~$600-800**

**Then:**
- Install Ubuntu (free)
- Set up SSH server
- Connect from laptop

## Bottom Line

**If you want the ThinkCentre:**
- Buy it with Windows (you'll pay for it)
- Install Linux when you get it
- Don't use Windows
- **You still get a great desktop, just pay for Windows you won't use**

**If you want to save money:**
- **Custom build** - No Windows, install Linux yourself
- **Save $100-200** (no Windows license)
- **Best value**

**Recommendation:** Buy ThinkCentre with Windows, install Linux. The Windows cost is built into the price, but you can ignore it and use Linux. Or custom build to avoid paying for Windows entirely.
