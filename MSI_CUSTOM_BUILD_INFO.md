## My Recommendation

**For your desktop build:**

**Use PC Part Picker to plan:**
1. Go to **pcpartpicker.com**
2. Select **MSI motherboard** (B550 or X570)
3. Select other parts
4. Check compatibility
5. See best prices

**Then:**
- Buy MSI components from Newegg, Amazon, Micro Center
- Build yourself or use Micro Center build service
- Install Linux (Ubuntu)

**Or:**
- Buy MSI pre-built desktop
- Install Linux when you get it
- Don't use Windows

## Bottom Line

**MSI is a hardware manufacturer, not a build service.**

**Best approach:**
1. Use **PC Part Picker** to plan your build
2. Include **MSI components** (motherboard, case, etc.)
3. Buy from **Newegg/Amazon/Micro Center**
4. Build yourself or use **Micro Center build service**
5. Install **Linux** (Ubuntu)

**MSI makes great components, but you'll still need to plan the build (PC Part Picker) and buy/build it yourself (or use Micro Center).**

**MSI components are quality - use them in your custom build planned on PC Part Picker!**
