## My Recommendation

**If you want Maingear:**
- Go to **maingear.com**
- Configure your build
- Select "No OS" option
- They build it, you install Linux
- **Cost: ~$1,000-1,200** (parts + build fee)

**But consider:**
- **Micro Center** - Better prices, build service (~$150)
- **PC Part Picker** - Cheapest, build yourself

**Maingear is great if you want professional build and warranty, but it's more expensive than building yourself or using Micro Center.**
