# Render Workspace Configuration

## Your Workspaces
- **hobby** (Workspace ID: tea-cspa963gbbvc73balc00)
- **legacy**

## Setting the Workspace

To use the Render MCP server, I need to set the active workspace. 

**Set workspace to: "hobby"**

This will allow me to:
- Access your `pca-app` service
- Read logs
- Check deployment status
- View service details

## After Workspace is Set

Once the workspace is set, I can:
- ✅ Read logs from `pca-app` service instantly
- ✅ Check deployment status
- ✅ View service configuration
- ✅ Better debugging workflow
